## How to run the game?
* It is recommended to open all the files in a code editor such as VS Code (Preferably)
* If not already downloaded, you need to ensure that you have downloaded the latest version of [JAVA](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/).
* After downloading JAVA and the necessary code editor, you need to open the Terminal on your device
* After installing pygame, you need to go back to the code editor and open the terminal in the directory in which the files are located. 
* After starting the terminal you need to open the Main.java file on your code editor
* Upon opening the Main.java file you can do one of two things:
* You can either run the game by clicking on the run button (A Play Button) at the top - right of the window
* Or you can enter this in the terminal to compile the files

```
javac Main.java
```
